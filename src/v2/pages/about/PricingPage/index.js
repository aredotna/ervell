            <Question>Why do most people upgrade to Are.na Premium?</Question>
            <Answer>
              The main reason is privacy. With a regular plan you can only hide
              100 “blocks,” or individual pieces of content on Are.na. Premium
              gives you unlimited space to collaborate privately for personal or
              professional purposes.
            </Answer>

            <Question>What are blocks and channels?</Question>
            <Answer>
              A block is any individual piece of content on Are.na, such as an
              image, a document, a video, or a web page. You add blocks to
              collections called channels.
              <br />
              <br />
              You can connect any block you see on Are.na to one of your own
              channels by clicking the “connect” button. You can also add one
              channel to another channel the same way. Very meta.
            </Answer>

            <Question>
              What happens if I hit the private block limit on the regular plan?
            </Question>
            <Answer>
              You’ll be prompted to upgrade to Premium. You can still use Are.na
              as normal, you just won’t be able to add more private blocks.
            </Answer>

            <Question>
              Can I collaborate with other people on Are.na without paying?
            </Question>
            <Answer>
              Of course! The whole point of Are.na is to build channels together
              and learn from one another. You’ll still be limited to 50 private
              blocks, but you can collaborate on as many public channels as you
              want.
            </Answer>

            <Question>
              Can I pay month-to-month for my Are.na Premium membership?
            </Question>
            <Answer>
              Yes.
              <br />
              <br />
              Are.na Premium costs $5 per month or $45 per year, depending on
              how you prefer to pay.
            </Answer>

            <Question>
              How does Are.na process my payment? Can I pay with Paypal?
            </Question>
            <Answer>
              We handle billing via Stripe. If you’d like to use Paypal instead,
              please email us at{' '}
