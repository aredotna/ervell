        | The web today is dominated by platforms which make money by manipulating our attention and harvesting our personal information to sell ads. We believe it takes a different value proposition to build a better online social space.

        | Are.naâ€™s mission is to build a member-supported community for shared knowledge and lifelong learning. Since we're accountable to our Premium members instead of advertisers, our incentive is always to build a tool that fosters focus and genuine collaboration.

        | We created Are.na because we wanted a way to build on each other's ideas in real time. There are other platforms for sharing and "liking." We're interested in making connections that expand our ways of thinking about the world. When you make collections on Are.na, you're adding to a publicly accessible library where many forms of knowledge can thrive.
