        | Are.na lets you save all kinds of content into simple, visual collections called channels. Channels and their contents can be reused by many people in different contexts, creating an interactive web of shared knowledge. 

      p.Type.Type--lh-tall.AboutParagraph
        | While Are.na brings together elements of social and productivity apps, it’s really a tool for visualizing, sharing, and building ideas together. Whether you’re making a mood board, organizing dissertation references, or just taking notes, it can help you structure your thoughts and make discoveries over time.

        | The web today is dominated by platforms which make money by addicting, surveilling, and manipulating us. We think a better online social space means starting with a different value proposition.

      p.Type.Type--lh-tall.AboutParagraph
        | Are.na’s mission is to build a member-supported community for shared knowledge and lifelong learning. Instead of distraction and fomo, it’s our goal to foster curiosity and collaboration. Because Are.na is supported by Premium members, our incentive is always to cultivate a tool and a social context that help you focus.

        | We built Are.na because we needed a better way to share projects and ideas with each other. Instead of showing off finished projects, we wanted a tool that invited other people into the creative process. Are.na is a space where every idea is a work in progress and you can always build on what your collaborators have started.
