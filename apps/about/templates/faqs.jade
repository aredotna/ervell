    h2.is-left What should I use Are.na for? Why should I use it instead of other bookmarking and organization tools?
    p People who use Are.na as a daily tool appreciate the dynamism between private and public collaboration. Content is easily connected between different topics and channels, resulting in discovery of information and organic archives.
    p Play around for a while: adding content, connecting and discovering users is the best way to find out the platform's qualities.

    h2.is-left What are channels?
    p A channel is a grouping of images, links, files, and texts. You can create and organize them privately, publicly and collaboratively.
    h2.is-left What's the difference between open, closed and private channels?
    p Channels have privacy settings that determine who can view or add to them. When creating a channel, you can choose your privacy settings.

    h2.is-left Can someone else moderate or modify my channels?
