      | What should I use Are.na for?
    p.Type.Type--lg.Type--lh-tall
      | There is no right or wrong way to use Are.na. It's an open-ended space where you can organize your thoughts, projects, or research with anyone else. Play around for a while: adding content, connecting channels, and discovering new users are the best ways to get a feel for how Are.na works.
    h3.Type.Type--size-h3
      | How is Are.na different from other bookmarking and productivity sites?
    p.Type.Type--lg.Type--lh-tall
      | Built around simple collections that link together into expansive networks, Are.na represents a cooperative model for organizing media and ideas — free of ads, likes, algorithms, or distractions. Think of it as an organic archive of all kinds of knowledge, built by thoughtful people in order to learn and discover new things.

      | What are channels?
    p.Type.Type--lg.Type--lh-tall
      | A channel is simply a collection of images, links, files, and texts. What it becomes is up to you and whoever you share it with. A channel can be a reading list, a research archive, a brainstorming canvas, or a mood board, but it can also be a mindmeld between collaborators, a calm headspace for your thoughts, or a poem.
    p.Type.Type--lg.Type--lh-tall
      | You can create your own channels and make them private, public, or open to invited collaborators only.
    h3.Type.Type--size-h3
      | What's the difference between open, closed and private channels?
    p.Type.Type--lg.Type--lh-tall
      | Channels have privacy settings that determine who can view or add to them. Open channels are channels that anyone can view and add to. Closed channels can be seen by everyone, but can only be edited by invited collaborators. Private channels can only be seen or edited by invited collaborators.
    p.Type.Type--lg.Type--lh-tall
      | You can choose the privacy setting when you create a channel. If a someone else makes an open channel or invites you to their closed channel, you can connect anything you see on Are.na to it.
